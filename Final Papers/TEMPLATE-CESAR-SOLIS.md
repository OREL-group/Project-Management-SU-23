## IS340 Term Paper SkillFullHands.com
### Abstract
This paper is going to outline the target audience, project scope, and scaling, and the different developmental phases of the website called “"Skillfullhands.com,". This project is designed to help unemployment among blue collar workers. I will also use concepts and ideals learned in IS 340 to bring the project to life.
### Purpose
The main purpose of the website is to help reduce unemployment and increase access to jobs. The website “skillfullhands.com” would focus on helping struggling blue collar workers to  find a job. Since most blue collar jobs are project based there is a constant hunt for the next job and  future projects. For example a carpenter would only be paid while finishing the framework of a house. Once they are finished they would again look for  another opportunity to work on another project.  My website would work as a central hub to access listings of projects and resources to find jobs for laborers. 
Having this website would allow increased access to opportunities. Blue-collar workers who are struggling to find jobs due to limited job listing sites and effective search channels could use my site to find projects or jobs that would otherwise go unnoticed.

Job listings sites like Linkedin do not effectively help the search for labor-based jobs. Based on this graph from Statista only about 20% percent of Linkedin users don't have advanced college education.

Linkedin mostly focuses on work that is for people who have college degrees. Blue collar workers in majority don't have college degrees. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics the 80% of the Hispanic population in the labor force do not have a bachelors. 70% of the black population do not have bachelors degree either. This demographic are not being helped by websites like linkedin. 

The website Skillfullhands.com would help this demographic to find a job without a degree. By providing access to a bigger variety of jobs, the website would promote diversity within the labor force.

Overall the website's main focus would be the job seekers. However most blue-collar jobs require you to learn and have experience with the skill. There would be a part of the website that facilitates companies on finding candidates to recruit and to teach the trade.

### Target Audience
Determining the correct target for your product can either break or make your project. This project is no different. Without a target audience it is nearly impossible to have an effective purpose and direction for your product. Also determining your target audience can help with finances. This will be explained further later in the essay.

As stated before the main target audience of  SkillFullHands.com would be male blue collar workers. In general laborers and blue collar workers are self identified male. Targeting female blue collar workers would limit my audience and thus shorten the reach of the website.

However, my target audience is not only limited to blue collar workers. Employers and businesses would also be part of the target audience. Small businesses and employers looking to fill in positions for areas in construction ,manufacturing, agriculture and other industries can use this website to recruit workers. Also the average person looking to hire a tradesman like a plumber could also use this website to hire someone.

Staffing agencies dedicated to recruiting tradesmen and blue collar workers on behalf of employers and businesses would also be using the website.  

### Project Scope and Scaling

Being a 1 person team in the beginning of the project development it is vital to have realistic standards for the type of quality of work a single website developer can do. At first the website would be bare bones. I will focus on the user interaction and user interface of the website. If a website is not designed well or you can not interact with it smoothly no one would want to use the website.

In the beginning the website would focus on the core functions of a job website. It will be able to connect people who are seeking employment to employers and recruiters. Elements like job listings, a search bar, user profiles, and potentially messaging is crucial to be able to connect employers to candidates.

Once there is more momentum to the website and traction I would like to scale the website to match the number of users. At this point in time there would be a team/company  helping on maintaining and developing the website. By having more developers it would be possible to have more advanced functions and components to the website. Having a function that matches candidates skills to a specific job automatically can greatly help for job research and make the process easier. Also optimizing the website and infrastructure  to handle more users is crucial to the website to stay working. Many of the user's personal information would be stored in the website. It is crucial for the website to focus on security and data protection to avoid leaks. Incorporating location to job searching in the website would be great for finding jobs that are close to the candidate.

### Open Source and Acess

Having an open source and access website can bring several advantages to my website. Earlier in the project scope and scaling section of my paper I talked about how in the beginning it would be a 1 person team and then when the website grows it would eventually become a company and allow a whole team to focus on development of the website. By having an open source project it would allow the journey of being a one person developer to a team become a lot easier to achieve. Just because it is open source and access does not mean they can freely edit the website. I would change the code with permission and review it first. These restrictions would allow me to prevent coders with malicious intent to manipulate the code directly.

By having a website with an open source MIT license it would allow community contributions to the websites. It would allow website developers interested in the website or make a Linkedin competitor to contribute improvements. They can fix bugs and add new improved features.

Allowing more people to access the website code would allow rapid development in theory. By having more developers working and collaborating on the website by adding updates, enhancements quickly, can alleviate my workload and focus to develop the website faster.Having a diverse set of people working on the website can allow innovation. They would come up with features that I would not think of and/or be able to do on my own with my current skills.Also having more people having access to the code can allow detecting bugs and be able to fix them faster.

Since this would be a new website with a different user base there can be a certain amount of skepticism regarding the website. Having open access to the code users can see that there is no malicious code trying to take advantage of the users and benefit with their private information. Employees and job seekers can see that the website has good intentions. Having an open access code would allow transparency and trust in the users.

Having limited resources I can use whatever I can. Normally having these contributions would cost me  hundreds of thousands of expenses in salary. However the website being open source would reduce development costs and can allocate the saved resources in other areas.

Despite in the future hopefully having a full team and company I would still have an open source website. This would allow long term sustainability. The community can still be able to continuously improve and evolve the project. Even if me and the future time becomes stagnant.

### Developmental Stages

Having a short term and a long term plan is useful for the organization of the project and to keep myself accountable to meet goals and deadlines.

The first phase would consist of laying out the foundations of the website. The first step is defining the concept of my website. I have to identify my main target audience , core purpose and proposition.After this I need to do more in depth market research. I have to see what the competition excels and lacks. Then gather what I learn and incorporate it into the website. I also would need to find out ways to have good user retention. Further research is needed to know what is the minimum amount of features I can have to have the website usable. This is vital to know so I will not overwork myself, or get too frustrated. Choosing the logo, and the layout of the website is important to do early on.

Phase 2 consists of financing the project. The main early on expense for this project would be marketing. I would need to market to reach potential contributors since the community as a whole would help develop this website. Also aside from marketing, maintaining the website up and running can be costly. I would either pay monthly, or yearly fees to web hosting services. I have to buy the domain name. I have to get developmental tools and even get my own network to host the website once it grows in users. Also marketing to the actual users would be expensive.

Crowdfunding websites like Kickstarter would be a way I would fund my website. It is effective and easy to do. Since the website team would be very small I would heavily rely on small scale grants like the grants provided by NumFOCUS. This grant is dedicated to fund and help build project communities which is crucial to this specific project to succeed. I would also be using my own money to fund the project.

Once I have a clear vision of the website and the foundations are set Phase 3 would start. Once I have a bare bones website I would implement the open source MIT license so the community could make contributions.This step is by far the most important step. The community would have a huge part in developing the website. It is crucial that I keep the community organized in my github.  I would set up a repository and publish my code into Github. In this repository I would use the READ.ME section to inform the purpose of my website and the mission. It would also inform contributors setup instructions, and any guidelines I would impose.

To have good retention of contributors, documentation is crucial. I'm planning to have a community dashboard. This dashboard would be used as a visualization for many different aspects of the repository. For example I would do a data visualization of contributions over time. To incentivize contributors and developers to contribute a lot by highling the top contributors of the month. Alongside making a list of top contributors I can also award contribution badges.

Phase 4 would be the last stage. Once the website grows in user an popularity I would transition this project to a 501(c)(3): non-operating foundation. This website would be almost impossible to maintain and manage with a small team. The team developing the website has to match to growing user base.The team has to be paid. In order to afford the salary, having a parent company like Linkedin is important. They can provide a lot more funds for marketing and other expenses like salaries. At this point the website would have a full blown company to support my project and it would be considered a “success”

### Conclusion

In conclusion Skillhands.com would be used to help unemployment between blue collar workers. It would help job seekers find and fill in the gap between employers and candidates. Blue collar workers tend to be left behind in tech and job listing sites. This website would be developed towards their job searching needs.
