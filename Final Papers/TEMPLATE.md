### Background
[Comment_3]: <> (begin your text here)

As recent headlines and news would suggest, the subjects of sexual health and access have been hotly debated on all stages, from federal courts to state legislatures, and has bred an epidemic of misinformation and broad sensationalizing of abortion, LGBTQ care and education, and sexual health education. According to Pagato et al. (2023), the reversal of Roe v. Wade has triggered a chain reaction that has produced unprecedented misinformation:
>The recent reversal of Roe v. Wade given way to an abortion infodemic that is being exacerbated by a confusing and rapidly changing legislative landscape, the proliferation of abortion disinformants on the web, lax efforts by social media companies to abate abortion misinformation, and proposed legislation that threatens to prohibit the distribution of evidence-based abortion information” (Pagato 2023). 

Similarly, misrepresentations of gender-affirming care have proliferated as transgender care access has become an issue that is impossible to ignore across conservative America in Republican-dominated state legislatures. According to McNamara et al. (2022), over 20 bills that criminalize the standard care for gender-diverse youth have been recently introduced in the state legislatures and three have passed (p.251). McNamara et al. further state that these state legislatures have “proved fertile ground for the intentional misrepresentation of gender-affirming care (GAC)” and that “elected officials rarely offer scientific, peer-reviewed sources in the anti-GAC bills”( p.251), citing anti-LGBTQ political organizations as medical authorities. With policy being the main controller of the quality of education students receive in the United States and local school districts playing an outsized role in what is taught, it is my concern that the quality of basic sexual education and related topics is severely lacking. 

While news, media, and politics remain transfixed on access to abortion and gender-affirming care, sexual health education and awareness requires attention. As the aforementioned subjects suffer from politicized propaganda that fails to acknowledge or account for truthful evidence and facts, sexual health has long been a taboo subject for young Americans, and public education systems have been, for the most part, entirely inadequate to educate young, sexually active people on what healthy choices and practices are, as well as what the resources are that exist to support them. 

This due in part to the power that local governments have over what subjects are taught in school districts. While some schools may opt to teach comprehensive sex health, others may opt to teach pared down or outdated curriculum. Health authorities such as the Illinois Department of Public Health, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make efforts to publish accurate, useful information. However, as stated, dissemination of these facts falls to local school districts, which may distort these facts or omit them entirely. Furthermore, much of the government-provided information that is published is in the form of clunky websites, crowded brochures, or academic papers and studies which all require a great deal of initiative and effort to navigate and understand, and lack accessible, concise, and digestible information. 

On a more local level, the need to address sexual health is clear as well. According to countryhealthrankings.org, Champaign County experienced far more instances of chlamydia per 100,000 people on average compared the state average, 745.4 to 542.3 respectively, not to mention that the state average itself ranks higher than the national average of 481.3.1

In Illinois, public education of sexual health subjects is relatively unregulated, and what this education looks like depends almost entirely on local school district policy and the individual teacher teaching the material. With this in place, education may be more than comprehensive with right teacher and district guidelines or lack the right information and may practice fearmongering or abstinence-only education.  In Illinois’s case, topics such as LGBT identities and experiences are not required, and again, individual school districts still have local control over curriculum and are not even required to teach sex education at all. With such a wide range of education from place to place within the state, incoming college students arrive with an incredibly variable amount of sexual education. It is within this context that sexual education, particularly with young adults in college aged 18-21, must be addressed.

### Target Demographic and Community

[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)

The intended group to affect is college students, with resources and deliverables intended to cater to their needs and specific gaps in understanding. While this is a narrow scope to start, the hope is that as the project expands and deliverables are created, peer-reviewed, and published, the project will be applicable to most college campuses, regardless of exact location. Due to the complex nature of sexual health and its potentially sensitive nature, the project is intentionally a sort of “band-aid solution” to the problem of non-comprehensive, lacking sex ed since the education of minors requires parental consent, which is commonly cited as the primary hurdle to comprehensive sex ed reform. The priority of the project is provide any interested academic parties, such as health departments, student health organizations, housing departments, etc., with the deliverables to address students’ lack of awareness and education. As the project is made best to cater to UIUC’s primarily midwestern student body, it will have a rather specific focus at first. 

The project will be open and available to any interested parties via forking to cater to individual campuses. However, considering the project scope and topic matter, constant peer-review and evaluation will be needed to ensure quality and factual accuracy. With this, a strong and involved community will need to be created and maintained. A combination of students with high-quality contributions, healthcare professionals, and well-researched individuals are the hopeful contributors to the project. The hope is to attract talent by word of mouth, physical flyers, reaching out to on-campus health authorities, and relevant student organizations. Once an initial, qualified team is established, new contributors can be sought out and recruited. A structure of badges and titles will be used to create contributor hierarchy, establishing which contributors need approval and have certain permissions, and have further authority to approve submissions and contributions. Initial core team members to be granted full permissions will be recruited and approved after interview. As specific initiatives develop, team leaders can be appointed to lead teams towards achieving specific deliverables and prototypes by said core team. The final lineup of newest recruits will be able to contribute to any aspect of the project but will require peer-review and approval from team leaders. Integration of the project into each campus it is adopted or forked by with student organizations or university-affiliated health authorities will keep it sustained and relevant. Once affiliated with these entities, rollover and staffing will be shifted to these specific campuses, with resources and deliverables changing as such and as needed.

### Goals

The first goal is to establish a small team of concerned individuals to go about the initial task of scoping the campus-specific situation of sexual health resource awareness and base level education. This will be done as outlined in other sections of this proposal: word of mouth, outreach to campus and student organizations, flyers, and online outreach (i.e., reddit).

Once this team is established, campus-specific research can be conducted in the form of surveys and voluntary interviews. An understanding of common gaps in sex ed received and awareness of campus resources are the first priorities. Surveys will be pursued in higher quantities to collect numerically expressible metrics, by rating most questions on a scale from 1 to 5. Interviews will be conducted on a case by case, voluntary basis in teams of two with one recorder. In these interviews, information about specific shortcomings of sexual health received in the past will be ascertained and details about the interviewee’s awareness of campus resources will be questioned. The basic survey metrics will also be assessed. All respondents of the survey and interviewees will be notified of how their responses may be used, the intention of the project, and are given the option to opt out at any point and have their data removed and deleted. It will be made clear all survey and interview responses are anonymized. The identifying markers to be collected, at option, are gender, sexual orientation, age, and home state/country to maintain some level of understanding of who our respondents are and to be certain that we are not barking up the wrong tree (i.e., interviewing mostly one gender, skewing towards only out-of-state students, etc.). A balance is critical to have useful conclusions and to make meaningful deliverables.

After a baseline of understanding is established, the primary team can go about prototyping and developing deliverables in whatever form best suited to the student body. A solution that balances feasibility and effectiveness will be prioritized. Once initial prototypes are made, they should be evaluated by members of the target demographic for effectiveness and appeal. Potential official entities that may utilize our deliverables will be consulted for hypothetical use and deployment, constructive criticism, and other feedback. 
The ultimate goal of this project is to make an open repository of resources that are free to use to increase campus awareness of sexual health resources, and by extension, conventional health resources, and educate the general student body of concise, easily understood factoids that meaningfully impact them and their ability to make informed decisions. With that, the hope is that the repository would eventually be forked by other universities, colleges, and other higher education institutions to empower and inform their students.

### Project Management

This project would be hosted across multiple platforms to best utilize the best app for the intended function. For communication, Microsoft teams in tandem with Outlook would be used since every student and faculty member at the University of Illinois is assigned a Microsoft account. This eliminates the need to create special, single use accounts and makes reaching out to new contributors extremely simple since the organization contains the contact information of all University-affiliated persons. The Teams app offers countless features to customize schedules, create large group chats, subdivide people, and has user hierarchy built-in to moderate contributors and teams. It also has video conferencing capabilities that will make scheduling and conducting meetings convenient. With a built-in calendar, teams can keep track of event and meetings times communicated over Teams messages and Outlook emails. If shift-assigned moderation ever becomes necessary, Teams also has shift scheduling available for use. 

Since contributors will have computers, phones, and other devices of varying operating systems and differing proficiencies with collaborative software, Google Drive will be used to work together to create documents, presentation, and deliverables. It offers an intuitive user interface that will be easy to use for newcomers, and University emails offer free google accounts in addition to their Microsoft accounts with the same email (or netID). This will still make sharing with other collaborators easy since netIDs will still be tied to the same people the way they are in Teams/Outlook. Google Drive’s Slides and Docs are compatible with word and can be exported as such. Files can be easily uploaded into shared folders so that everyone may access the necessary files to work efficiently. 
 
While somewhat redundant, GitHub would be used to make the project publically available and viewable to anyone. Since the project, at least from the start, is not intended to be very code-based in its deliverables, it is not intended to be the site of collaboration at the beginning of the project. GitHub is unique compared to Google Drive in its repository structure and forking. This will allow for any outside, interested parties and organizations to fork and utilize it. When resources from Google Drive are copied over to Github, they are done so to provide a convenient means of redistributing our work for modification. Google drive as laid out for use in this project would be impossible to track once copied, but Github lets us see forks and changes made. Furthermore, once code contribution begin to make sense for the project, Github will be a far greater means of modifying the project. Google Drive is somewhat of a step stone to the ultimate goal of utilizing GitHub exclusively for its various tools and built-to-share interface and resources. For instance, once templates for deliverables such as posters and informational campaigns are made, these could be made into templates with code to make something that spits out customized materials for anyone who seeks to use our project.

The Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) would be used for this Github project, as it contains the best conditions and limitations for use. It is a non-copyleft license. Since sexual health is a sensitive topic, it would be best that the resources and deliverables posted not be modified without appropriate credit, a link to our license, and an indication that changes were made. The last point is most critical, since we want to avoid the inaccurate, deceptive, or otherwise low-quality modification of our resources which would damage its credibility. That being said, the posted files should be easy to copy and redistribute in any medium or format and should be adaptable to each fork since we want our deliverables to have the ability to cater to any specific setting. This may include different university branding, tailored titling, and customization to curriculum that does not alter its contents. Another critical aspect of this license is the reasonableness and no endorsement clauses. Frankly, since sexual health initiatives can run up against strong opposition, it is best that the original project is not the target by association of any modified use case that might garner public scrutiny or political attack due to modification of the original material or any implied endorsement. Finally, the material is “[offered] as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material”.  This is best to acknowledge the fact that this project will likely be made by individuals that are not in the healthcare industry, and thus, cannot be completely correct and true at all times, despite best efforts made to ensure it is as such. With no warranty or representation being made, the project is immune to slanderous fact checking or other hostile effort. 

### Sustainability

A project as health oriented as this one requires initiatives to keep data and information relevant and up to date. As new health data is published, our deliverables should be updated to reflect this. Any resources that refer to links should also constantly be checked since health authority links may change or become broken over time without updates. For example, if any resources include a QR code that forwards scanners to sites for further reading or reference, they should have a middleman website that is updated by the moderators of the project so that the QR code itself is never broken, and can provide updated links as needed. 

Concerning the sustaining of contributors and moderators, efforts will be made to tie the project to official student organizations and university health authorities. By involving these organizations in an official capacity, contributors can be recruited from the members, who are constantly rolling over. While the project should seek out and constantly retain as many contributors as possible independently of any campus organizations, tying it to organizations that will almost certainly retain and renew members yearly is a good approach. It also ensures a likely interested population will be made aware of the project.

In addition to working towards membership and higher permissions levels for moderating and contributing, a simple system of badges assigned to contributors who have contributed certain numbers of approved materials will be assigned. This is to encourage engagement and to acknowledge contributors for their efforts, and to provide a point of pride for them in addition to the valuable work they may have already put in.

### Conclusion      

[Comment_7]: <> (begin your text here)


Sexual Health is a complex and nuanced subject in the United States for as long as public education has been concerned over. In recent years, it has reached a fever pitch, with state legislatures waging partisan battles over health access and educational policy, that attempts to cement Americans into two binary camps with no in-between with closely related topics such as abortion access, gender-affirming care, and LBGTQ+ education. Concerning K-12 education however, the fight is a quieter one, but one that is arguably just a fierce of a battle. This project attempts to address gaps in primarily United States sexual health education and versions offered abroad among college-aged undergraduate students, and to understand why students lack adequate sexual health education which empowers them to make safe and informed decisions. The scope will be kept on campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and expand elsewhere across colleges universities as the project is established.
