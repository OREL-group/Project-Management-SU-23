### Abstract   

[Comment_1]: <> (begin your text here)

Sexual Health is a complex and nuanced subject in the United States for as long as public education has been concerned over. In recent years, it has reached a fever pitch, with state legislatures waging partisan battles over health access and educational policy, that attempts to cement Americans into two binary camps with no in-between with closely related topics such as abortion access, gender-affirming care, and LBGTQ+ education. Concerning K-12 education however, the fight is a quieter one, but one that is arguably just a fierce of a battle. This project attempts to address gaps in primarily United States sexual health education and versions offered abroad among college-aged undergraduate students, and to understand why students lack adequate sexual health education which empowers them to make safe and informed decisions. The scope will be kept on campus at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and expand elsewhere across colleges universities as the project is established.

### Background
[Comment_3]: <> (begin your text here)

As recent headlines and news would suggest, the subjects of sexual health and access have been hotly debated on all stages, from federal courts to state legislatures, and has bred an epidemic of misinformation and broad sensationalizing of abortion, LGBTQ care and education, and sexual health education. According to Pagato et al. (2023), the reversal of Roe v. Wade has triggered a chain reaction that has produced unprecedented misinformation:
The recent reversal of Roe v. Wade given way to an abortion infodemic that is being exacerbated by a confusing and rapidly changing legislative landscape, the proliferation of abortion disinformants on the web, lax efforts by social media companies to abate abortion misinformation, and proposed legislation that threatens to prohibit the distribution of evidence-based abortion information” (Pagato 2023). 

Similarly, misrepresentations of gender-affirming care have proliferated as transgender care access has become an issue that is impossible to ignore across conservative America in Republican-dominated state legislatures. According to McNamara et al. (2022), over 20 bills that criminalize the standard care for gender-diverse youth have been recently introduced in the state legislatures and three have passed (p.251). McNamara et al. further state that these state legislatures have “proved fertile ground for the intentional misrepresentation of gender-affirming care (GAC)” and that “elected officials rarely offer scientific, peer-reviewed sources in the anti-GAC bills”( p.251), citing anti-LGBTQ political organizations as medical authorities. With policy being the main controller of the quality of education students receive in the United States and local school districts playing an outsized role in what is taught, it is my concern that the quality of basic sexual education and related topics is severely lacking. 

While news, media, and politics remain transfixed on access to abortion and gender-affirming care, sexual health education and awareness requires attention. As the aforementioned subjects suffer from politicized propaganda that fails to acknowledge or account for truthful evidence and facts, sexual health has long been a taboo subject for young Americans, and public education systems have been, for the most part, entirely inadequate to educate young, sexually active people on what healthy choices and practices are, as well as what the resources are that exist to support them. 

This due in part to the power that local governments have over what subjects are taught in school districts. While some schools may opt to teach comprehensive sex health, others may opt to teach pared down or outdated curriculum. Health authorities such as the Illinois Department of Public Health, or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention make efforts to publish accurate, useful information. However, as stated, dissemination of these facts falls to local school districts, which may distort these facts or omit them entirely. Furthermore, much of the government-provided information that is published is in the form of clunky websites, crowded brochures, or academic papers and studies which all require a great deal of initiative and effort to navigate and understand, and lack accessible, concise, and digestible information. 

On a more local level, the need to address sexual health is clear as well. According to countryhealthrankings.org, Champaign County experienced far more instances of chlamydia per 100,000 people on average compared the state average, 745.4 to 542.3 respectively, not to mention that the state average itself ranks higher than the national average of 481.3.1

In Illinois, public education of sexual health subjects is relatively unregulated, and what this education looks like depends almost entirely on local school district policy and the individual teacher teaching the material. With this in place, education may be more than comprehensive with right teacher and district guidelines or lack the right information and may practice fearmongering or abstinence-only education.  In Illinois’s case, topics such as LGBT identities and experiences are not required, and again, individual school districts still have local control over curriculum and are not even required to teach sex education at all. With such a wide range of education from place to place within the state, incoming college students arrive with an incredibly variable amount of sexual education. It is within this context that sexual education, particularly with young adults in college aged 18-21, must be addressed.
