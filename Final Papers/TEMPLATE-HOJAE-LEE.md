### Introduction    
Over the last few decades, the tourism industry has experienced a revolution with the development of digital technology. The development of web-based platforms, social media, and digital content has played a crucial role in the spread of the tourism industry, making it accessible to anyone, anytime, anywhere around the world. This paper presents a project management plan for an open source Japanese tourism guide web page creation. This webpage is designed to serve as a comprehensive, user-generated and edited platform that provides authentic and up-to-date regional information for travelers planning to travel to Japan. The platform complies with open source and open work principles and aims to build a community-centric, transparent, and collaborative environment that leverages user-based collective intelligence.

### Project Rationale
Japan has always been a popular travel destination for visitors from abroad thanks to its rich cultural heritage, and spectacular landscapes. However, despite the great merit travelers could experience, visiting Japan can be challenging due to language barriers and subtle cultural differences that can be confusing for tourists from different backgrounds. Although much signs and information is available in English, the Japanese language is still the dominant form of communication in many areas. 

Moreover, in order to fully appreciate the Japanese travel experience, the traveler must understand and respect the nation's deeply ingrained traditions and etiquette, which are essential elements of Japanese culture. Even those who are familiar with nearby cultural systems may encounter difficulties as a result of this cultural diversity. As an example, during my first trip to Japan, I faced difficulties adjusting to the subtle changes in etiquette and cultural norms despite having South Korean origin and living close to Japanese culture.

Throughout the years, there has been a demand for an extensive, easily accessible, and current resource for tourists from other countries, and following the COVID-19 pandemic, this need has grown especially urgent. Japan recently reopened its borders to foreign tourism after a long period of border closures brought on by the pandemic. Although this reopening has sparked renewed interest in visiting Japan, it also presents new difficulties for visitors as they negotiate modifications to local conditions and laws as a result of the pandemic.

Our open source webpage for the Japan tourist guide project aims to address these kinds of challenges by creating an online platform that tourists and locals can freely share their knowledge and experiences and tips about traveling in Japan. We can help overcome the language barriers and cultural differences and make traveling in Japan easy for anyone around the world.


### Target Audience
The process of understanding the target audience is a critical part of open-source project planning. Understanding the types and needs of the users consuming our product will allow us to design our website in the most efficient, user-friendly way possible and it will also guide the direction of website development. Initially, The website will be English based. However, since the purpose of this website is to have the locals and foreigners to interact effectively, the prototype of the website will need to support both English and Japanese. Additionally, according to the statistics provided by nippon.com, Japan is most visited by South Korea followed by Taiwan and the United States. Given the high volume of tourists from Japan’s closest neighbors, the website will ultimately support Korean and Chinese language as well. 

### Platform Components
The platform's key components include a searchable database, user-generated content, a discussion forum, an information editing feature, and a reward system.

The searchable database will include a broad array of information about various tourist destinations in Japan, which will be mainly categorized by the 7 most visited cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe, Fukuoka, Nagoya, and Sapporo, plus the other non mentioned distinctive cities labeled as ‘more regions’ or ‘others’ Information on tourist attractions, from historical sites and natural attractions to hotels, restaurants, shopping districts, and cultural events, will be provided to the users. This database will be designed for ease of navigation and the capability to provide real-time, accurate information to users.

Overall, the website will heavily rely on user-generated content. Past visitors or local residents will be encouraged to contribute their own experiences, provide reviews, photos, and tips about traveling in Japan. This element of the project seeks to utilize the vast wealth of knowledge and experiences of the user community, resulting in a travel guide that's rich, diversified, and constantly evolving. 

A discussion forum will be implemented to foster a sense of community among the platform's users. This forum will serve as a space for users to share their travel experiences, seek and provide advice, answer queries, and engage in meaningful conversations about various aspects of travel in Japan as well as including their experience rating on a scale of 1 to 10 points or 1 to 5 in stars. 

To ensure that the information provided on the platform remains accurate and relevant, users will be allowed to update and correct information through an information editing feature. This feature ensures that the platform stays current and responsive to changes, reflecting real-time information and updates. Also, In order for this function to work properly, the website administrator with decent knowledge of Japan will verify the provided information if necessary. 

A reward system will be incorporated to encourage active participation and contributions. Regular platform contributors will be acknowledged and recognized, encouraging a sense of community and ownership. These contributions can take the form of content creation, editing, or active forum participation.

The open-source nature of the project further enhances its versatility and adaptability. As the platform's codebase will be publicly accessible, developers from across the globe can contribute to the platform's development, improvement, and maintenance, leading to a user-friendly system that caters effectively to the needs of the traveling community.

The project aims to create a distinctive travel resource that combines these elements with open-source and working open principles and is not only a wealth of travel-related information about Japan but also a global community of travelers and enthusiasts sharing their love and knowledge about the country.

### Development
The project will be implemented in the following phases:

#### Phase I
Planning: The planning phase forms the groundwork of the project, laying the foundation on which all subsequent development work will rely. It involves defining the project scope and objectives, establishing a clear, actionable roadmap for development. Stakeholder identification during this phase ensures that all parties with an interest in the project are included from the onset. The technical requirements for the platform, including the selection of a technology stack, server requirements, and essential features, are also determined during this phase. Besides, a preliminary project timeline is defined to guide the development process.
#### Phase II
Development: In the website developing phase, a new repository will be initialized for the project, where all the necessary files and code for the website will be stored and managed through GitHub. For each new feature or bug fix, a branch will be created off the main branch. Once the development on these branches is complete and they have passed all the necessary tests, they will be merged back into the main branch.

#### Phase III
Testing: Testing is a very important phase where the platform undergoes various checks for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and user experience optimization. This process would involve both manual and automated testing, ranging from unit tests and integration tests to stress tests and accessibility tests.

#### Phase IV
Deployment and Promotion: After the platform has been tested, the website will be deployed on a live server, making it publicly accessible.
The promotion phase involves creating awareness about the platform to attract users and contributors. This could include activities such as social media campaigns, blog posts, outreach to travel communities, and collaborations with travel influencers.

#### Phase V
Community Building and Maintenance: After deployment, the project enters a crucial ongoing phase of maintenance and community building. Regular updates and bug fixes are needed to keep the platform running smoothly and this will be pushed through the repository which will allow the website hosted on GitHub to automatically reflect such changes. Additionally, a concerted effort to nurture the user and developer communities ensures a continuous stream of new content and contributions to the platform.

### Community Engagement
To evaluate more on the details of phase IV and V, as community engagement is an essential part of this project, creating a sense of community among the platform's users and contributors will be the key objective. To this end, multiple strategies will be employed. Regular virtual meetings or meet-ups will be organized among the administrators and publishers to provide a platform for users to connect, share their travel stories, and discuss potential improvements to the platform. The discussion forum will be actively moderated to foster a welcoming, inclusive environment that encourages active participation.

Active users and contributors of the website that provides quality content, will regularly be highlighted in the platform’s “user spotlight” section, recognizing their contributions and encouraging further participation . Every user of the platform who wish to post or edit information on the platform will need to log in to the website and create a profile. This profile will work as a small social network page. The users will be able to post their past photos of themselves in Japan and interact with other users through the like and comment function. This profile system will even allow the possibility of gamification techniques such as leaderboards, badges and levels. Overall, this will promote healthy competition and further engagement of the active users. 

### Sustainability
Ensuring the project's sustainability over the long term is also crucial. From a financial perspective, partnerships with travel companies, tourism boards, or advertisements could be considered in the system to provide a source of revenue to support the platform's maintenance and development. Actively involving influencers or YouTubers could help advertise both the platform and the travel spots as well. 

From a community perspective, continuously investing in community building efforts will ensure a steady stream of contributors and users. Regular updates, new features, and responsiveness to user feedback will keep the platform relevant and engaging, maintaining user interest over the long term.

Moreover, given the open-source nature of the project, encouraging new developers to contribute is essential. Offering clear documentation, maintaining an inclusive environment, and providing mentorship opportunities for new contributors can help ensure a sustainable pool of developers to maintain and improve the platform over time.
