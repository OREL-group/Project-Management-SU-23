HueHarmony is an innovative open-source makeup platform where users can actively contribute the hex code values of their favorite makeup products. This name not only conveys the platform's goal of helping users find the perfect makeup matches for their faces but also emphasizes the creation of a positive and collaborative space for developers, contributors, and users alike. Leveraging facial recognition and a sophisticated classification model, HueHarmony intelligently matches individuals to suitable makeup products. Unlike current technology, which is often brand-specific or lacks a comprehensive product database, HueHarmony addresses these challenges by relying on its open-source community for continuous contributions. Together, the community ensures a diverse and extensive collection of makeup options, making HueHarmony the go-to platform for personalized and inclusive beauty solutions.

### Introduction:
[Comment_3]: <> (begin your text here)
With the COVID-19 crisis, beauty-industry revenues fell 20 to 30 percent in 2020 (Gerstell et al., 2020). This was because “in most major beauty-industry markets, in-store shopping accounted for up to 85 percent of beauty-product purchases prior” (Gerstell et al., 2020). With the rise of online shopping, it is more difficult to shop for makeup products. It’s very difficult to see a product and predict how it will look on you. HueHarmony aims to overcome the limitations of existing makeup-matching technology. The problem lies in the constrained and brand-specific recommendations, leaving users with limited options that may not suit their unique preferences and features. To address this, HueHarmony takes a collaborative approach, inviting users to contribute the hex code values of their favorite makeup products. By doing so, it creates a harmonious and inclusive space for developers, contributors, and users, fostering a vibrant community. Leveraging facial recognition and a robust classification model, the platform provides accurate and tailored makeup recommendations, elevating users' beauty experiences. Through open-source collaboration, it aspires to empower individuals, offering a diverse and extensive makeup collection, and becoming the go-to platform for personalized and inclusive beauty solutions.


### Purpose:    

[Comment_4]: <> (begin your text here)
The purpose of HueHarmony is to provide an innovative and open-source makeup platform that offers personalized and inclusive makeup matching experiences. As indicated by recent research, there exists a prevalent challenge among makeup enthusiasts. Women are often uncertain about the right shades when purchasing cosmetic products, leading them to buy multiple shades at once. For instance, a substantial percentage have purchased multiple shades of lipstick (67%), foundation (54%), concealer (51%), blush (43%), eyeliner (35%), and mascara (35%) due to shade uncertainty (Ipsos, 2016). HueHarmony addresses this widespread dilemma by intelligently recommending makeup matches based on facial recognition, hex code values, and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging an open-source model, the platform empowers a collaborative community to contribute an array of makeup hex code values, resulting in an extensive and inclusive database of makeup products. The ultimate objective is to empower users to confidently find their perfect makeup matches, transcending skin tones, styles, and brand preferences. In doing so, HueHarmony fosters a positive and supportive space for developers, contributors, and users to collectively enhance the platform's capabilities, revolutionizing the beauty experience for all.

### Process and Features:    
[Comment_5]: <> (begin your text here)
Users of HueHarmony will be required to upload an image of themselves. An algorithm will then be used to identify the user's unique features. A hex code for their skin tone will be generated. By comparing this personalized hex code to an extensive database of makeup products, the platform will recommend foundation shades that harmonize seamlessly with the user's complexion. Other products such as lipstick will also be recommended based on the hex code for their skin tone. In the event that a user's preferred product is absent from the database, they will have the opportunity to contribute its hex code, which will then undergo verification by dedicated moderators to ensure the accuracy and inclusivity of the platform's offerings.

### Open Source:

For HueHarmony, the GNU General Public License (GPL), the MIT License, and the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) were considered. Each license contains distinct terms that govern software usage, distribution, and modification. The GPL requires any modifications or derivative works to also be open source under the GPL. The MIT License grants broad freedoms for using, modifying, and distributing software, including the possibility of incorporating it into proprietary projects. Lastly, the LGPL allows linking LGPL-licensed code with proprietary software, while modifications to LGPL components must remain open source. This allows for proprietary and open-source elements to coexist.
Among these licenses, the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is the best choice for HueHarmony. HueHarmony will be able to integrate open-source components while permitting proprietary features, striking a balance between community collaboration and proprietary innovation. This aligns seamlessly with the platform's ethos of community engagement and transparency without hampering innovations in proprietary software.
LGPL's allowance for collaborative enhancements without imposing an open-source requirement for the entire project fosters a vibrant community around HueHarmony. Moreover, as the platform aspires to foster partnerships and potential monetization avenues, LGPL's compatibility with commercial use and proprietary software ensures the project's sustainability. By selecting LGPL, HueHarmony will be able to blend open-source contributions and proprietary elements, amplifying its potential to revolutionize the makeup industry while safeguarding the flexibility to adapt to future needs.

HueHarmony will initially need investments allocated to the comprehensive development of the platform. This encompasses a fusion of frontend and backend engineering, integration of facial recognition technology, machine learning algorithms, and the crafting of a user-centric interface. Ongoing operational costs would include server hosting, security protocols, and responsive user support. Community engagement lies at the core of HueHarmony’s financial planning, as investments will next be channeled into fostering vibrant interactions within the community, facilitated by curated forums, interactive polls, helpful articles, and strategic social media campaigns. To generate capital, HueHarmony will rely on brand partnerships and crowdfunding. HueHarmony could also use targeted ads, however, in order to keep in line with our value on privacy, user permission to share data would be required.

### Coding Languages:
