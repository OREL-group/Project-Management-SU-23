   The Volvo EX30 was unveiled early this month, June 2023, and is a completely new model for the brand. It's their smallest vehicle yet, with a remarkably low base MSRP that puts it in-line with mainstream brands' current electric offerings, or even undercuts them in price.
   **Here are some interesting features:** 
   + EX30 includes multiple battery and motor configurations to both achieve a lower starting price and to offer range and power options to meet the differing needs of drivers.
   + In it's top specification, EX30 is the fastest Volvo car ever, capable of sprinting to 100 kph in 3.6 seconds.<sup>1</sup>
   + This vehicle has the lowest carbon footprint of any Volvo produced car to date and was designed to be as recyclable as possible when its serviceable life comes to an end.
   + The dashboard is symmetrical to streamline production for right and left-hand drive markets.
   + It looks *really* cool.

## Oaxacan Alebrijes
_An "ancient" artform (in some ways, and not literally)_

   I recently traveled to Mexico, and among the various cities we went to was Oaxaca de Juárez of the state of Oaxaca. Some of you may know of the colorful creatures called Alebrijes (roughly pronounced: Ah-Lay-Bree-Hez) from the Disney film "Coco" as the spirit guides of various characters.
   I went to a workshop that specializes in these carvings, which are made of a wood called Copal. Its soft character makes it a perfect carving wood. There, I learned that Alebrijes came into being only about 100 years ago in Mexico City from the Linares family. It eventually reached Oaxaca, where the Jimenez family adapted the original form of painted papier-mâché into Oaxacan woodcarving.
  
   So while the art of carving had been around for hundreds of years, the name and decorative style was a recent occurrence. I encourage you to look into the Jimenez family and their works. They have a very distinct style, and it was an honor to have been to their home and to have learned the story behind this craft. 

**Note:** While this information is what I remember from my workshop at the Jimenez home, here are some links where you can learn more:
